### âœ…Task Tracker CLI

A simple command-line interface (CLI) for managing tasks, built with JavaScript and Node.js. It connects to a Laravel API hosted on Render, using a PostgreSQL database to store tasks persistently. Features include adding, listing, completing, and deleting tasks with colorful output and loading animations.

### Introduction

Task Tracker CLI allows users to manage tasks efficiently via the terminal. Built with commander for command handling, axios for API requests, chalk for colored output, and ora for loading spinners, it interacts with a simple Laravel API i made to perform CRUD operations on tasks stored in PostgreSQL.

### Requirements
