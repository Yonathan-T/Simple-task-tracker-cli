## 🔧 First Time Setup

When you run any command for the first time, the CLI will:

1. Automatically create a unique user ID for you
2. Register you with the backend API
3. Store your user ID locally for future sessions
4. Proceed with your requested command

**Note:** You'll only see registration messages on your first use. Subsequent commands will run silently.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### No tasks found or API Errors

- Ensure the Laravel API is running at https://simple-task-api-88g5.onrender.com/
- Check your internet connection
- Verify the API endpoint is accessible

### CLI errors

- Ensure all dependencies are installed: `npm install`
- Make sure you're using Node.js version 16 or higher
- If installed globally, try reinstalling: `npm uninstall -g task-tracker-cli && npm install -g .`

### Command not found

- If using global installation, ensure the package is installed globally: `npm install -g .`
- Try running with node directly: `node tracker.js <command>`
